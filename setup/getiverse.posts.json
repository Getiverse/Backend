Even the cockpit was quite tight, and the bodywork enveloped the top of the steering wheel entirely. The mounting of the front suspension's strut was encased in a kind of \\\"bulb\\\" in the bodywork, a characteristic identical to the Leyton House design. One of the main innovations of the Williams FW14 was the raised chassis (a carbon monocoque) at the bottom, which then merged into a high and narrow nose. The raised chassis allowed for increased airflow under the car, then directed towards the radiators' intake. The side pods were very low, and the compact rear end tapered down towards the \\\"Coca-Cola\\\" area to enhance the extractor's efficiency. The car, as a whole, appeared very sleek, free from clutter, almost resembling a military jet from a frontal view. An aerodynamic gem introduced by Adrian Newey was the wing endplate wrapping internally around the front tire. The endplate was quite extensive, specially designed to maintain laminar flow and guide it around the front wheels. This reduced turbulence and allowed for a \\\"clean\\\" fluid dynamic profile even in the car's central area.

The British car in '92 employed hydro-pneumatic independent front suspension. Utilizing a push-rod layout, the entire suspension system was exclusively developed by Frank Williams' team. A hydraulic circuit connected the suspension struts via actuators, with an electronic control unit regulating the correct ride height. The small cover above the front suspension struts allowed for quick adjustments to the \\\"inboard\\\" shock absorbers and tie rods. In the illustration, we see the entire working of the active suspension on the Williams FW14: Actuators are shown in yellow, hydraulically connected to the struts and suspension arms, the electronic components are in green, and the large fluid reservoir is in blue, positioned behind the Renault engine.\"}]},{\"type\":\"p\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"h1\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"ENGINE AND GEARBOX\"}]},{\"type\":\"p\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"In terms of horsepower, the Renault engine powering the Williams FW14B might not have been the most potent, but it certainly was extremely reliable.

The Williams-Renault partnership is one of the most successful in F1 history, dominating much of the '90s. Since the end of this collaboration, Williams' descent began, and the team hasn't secured a title since 1997, the last year of the Anglo-French partnership. Adrian Newey has always favored the naturally aspirated engines from the French manufacturer, a choice he continued at Red Bull, where he also secured multiple world titles. The semi-automatic gearbox introduced in '91 had its fair share of mechanical issues during the season, preventing Williams from fully challenging the Senna-driven McLaren Honda, which went on to win both titles.
